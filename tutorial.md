# Personal Website Workshop

Personal websites are a fun way to express yourself on the Internet. Plus, they're great for learning web development.

This tutorial will makes a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com), but this advice is applicable to a static site hosted anywhere.

## Getting Started

Make a repository and git init it.

```bash
mkdir jplace.github.io
cd jplace.github.io
git init
```

Create a file called _index.html_. Put some HTML scaffolding in it.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Jordan Place</title>
    <style></style>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello, world!
  </body>
</html>
```
